    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "OGGM-Edu (http://edu.oggm.org) is an educational platform providing instructors with tools that allow the demonstration of the governing principles of glacier behaviour. It offers online interactive apps and Jupyter notebooks that can be run in a browser via MyBinder or JupyterHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how an open source numerical glacier model ([OGGM](http://oggm.org)) can be used to tackle scientific and socially-relevant research questions in class assignments and student projects. It is built on two complementary numerical experiments: \n",
    "1. the first section uses idealized glaciers (with controlled boundary conditions) to illustrate how climate and topography influence glacier behavior, and\n",
    "2. the second section relies on realistic glaciers to illustrate how downstream freshwater resources will be affected by glacier change in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook contains code sections that serve as templates, followed by research questions and suggestions that invite the student to re-run the experiment with updated simulation parameters. This notebook (as well as all other similar notebooks featured on the OGGM-Edu platform) is meant to be adapted by teachers to match the topics of a specific lecture or workshop. Interested readers will find more example notebooks [on OGGM-Edu](https://edu.oggm.org/en/latest/notebooks_index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "OGGM-Edu's notebooks can help students to overcome barriers posed by numerical modelling and coding, in a fun, question-driven and societally relevant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- teach about fundamental concepts in glaciology in a modern, fun and interactive way\n",
    "- a complex numerical model is used and abstracted (simplified) for teaching purposes\n",
    "- open and reproducible: the notebooks are all licensed with BSD3, we use openly available docker environments to run the notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook relies on a number of standard packages of the scientific python ecosytem: numpy, scipy, xarray, pandas, etc. The main tool used for the modelling of glaciers is the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM, http://oggm.org, https://docs.oggm.org). We also rely on a small number of helper functions (mostly to hide some of the OGGM internals to the learners) from the oggm-edu python package. For more details about OGGM-Edu, visit https://edu.oggm.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The main outcome of this example notebook is a template, that can be used in glaciology workshops and classes. Example applications include a three-day workshop in Peru for university students without prior experience in glaciology ([repository](https://github.com/ehultee/CdeC-glaciologia), [more info](https://oggm.org/2019/12/06/OGGM-Edu-AGU/)) or the University of Michigan CLaSP 474 [Ice and Climate notebooks](https://github.com/skachuck/clasp474_w2021).\n",

    "Unlike for Hintereisferner, these projections indicate that the annual runoff will increase in all the scenarios for the first half of the century. The higher RCP scenarios can reach **peak water** later in the century, since the excess melt can continue to increase. For the lower RCP scenarios on the other hand, the glacier might be approaching a new equilibirum, which reduces the runoff earlier in the century ([Rounce et. al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00331/full)). After **peak water** is reached (RCP2.6: ~2055, RCP8.5: ~2070 in these projections), the annual runoff begin to decrease. This decrease occurs because the shrinking glacier is no longer able to support the high levels of melt."
